If the interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation, it will first evaluate the operands of the expression. The evaluation of the operand (p) returns (p), resulting in infinite recursion.

If the interpreter uses normal-order evaluation, it will first expand the operator, then apply the first operand (0) to the conditional expression, returning the value 0 and never evaluating the operand (p).
